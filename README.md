# Work Day Planner - Mark Wilson
In this project I have created a work day planner for the client to organise their day hour by hour. It contains 9 rows each with a corresponding time(9am-5pm) and an input for the user to log their tasks for each hour. When the user presses the save button, the task for that hour is saved to the local storage so that it is persistent even after the page is refreshed.
Each row is also colour coded basked on whether it is the current, past or future hour.
Bootstrap.css is used for mobile responsiveness and JQuery.js is used for displaying data and checking for click events.
